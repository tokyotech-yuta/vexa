# deploy/compose — the v0.12 control-plane stack (P4)

`docker-compose.yml` brings up the v0.12 control plane: the infra (`postgres:17-alpine`,
`redis:7-alpine`, `minio` + `minio-init`) and the long-running services below, each building its own
slim image from `<service>/Dockerfile`:

| service      | build context                          | host port | entrypoint                         |
|--------------|----------------------------------------|-----------|------------------------------------|
| admin-api    | `core/identity/services/admin-api`     | 18057     | `python -m admin_api`              |
| runtime      | `core/runtime`                         | 18090     | `python -m runtime_kernel`         |
| meeting-api  | `core/meetings/services/meeting-api`   | 18080     | `python -m meeting_api`            |
| agent-api    | `core/agent/services/agent-api`        | 18100     | `uvicorn control_plane.api`        |
| gateway      | `core/gateway/services/gateway`        | 18056     | `python -m gateway`                |
| terminal     | `clients/terminal`                     | 13000     | Next.js custom server              |

Every service answers `GET /health` and carries a compose healthcheck; `depends_on` waits on
`condition: service_healthy` so the bring-up is ordered. The `runtime` mounts
`/var/run/docker.sock` and spawns the bot (`BROWSER_IMAGE=vexaai/vexa-bot:v012`, published — a
reference, never built here; never point it at the published `vexaai/vexa-bot:dev`, which is the
old 0.10 line and incompatible with this stack's `lifecycle.v1`) on demand and the per-dispatch
agent worker (`vexaai/v012-agent-worker:v012`, a `build-only` compose profile); neither is a
long-running compose service.

## Usage

```bash
cp .env.example .env            # edit secrets/ports/DOCKER_GID
docker compose -f deploy/compose/docker-compose.yml build
docker compose -f deploy/compose/docker-compose.yml up -d
# poll until healthy, then:
curl -sf http://localhost:18056/health   # gateway
docker compose -f deploy/compose/docker-compose.yml down -v
```

`.env.example` documents every variable (faithful to the 0.11 `deploy/compose` names: `DB_*`,
`REDIS_URL`, `ADMIN_TOKEN`, `INTERNAL_API_SECRET`, `MINIO_*`, `BROWSER_IMAGE`/`AGENT_IMAGE`,
`DOCKER_GID`, `*_HOST_PORT`).

## Smoke probe — "is this install actually working?"

```bash
make probe                       # from the repo root (compose is the default surface)
```

Drives the ONE full journey through the gateway front door — spawn → schedule → boot → join →
transcribe → live-view → stop — then sweeps every component's logs once. Each stage prints
Expected / Actual / Verdict; a red stage names where the journey broke and fails the command.
With the mock bot as `BROWSER_IMAGE` (`mock-bot:dev`) the journey is a deterministic green,
transcript included; with the real bot it drives a dead synthetic meeting to a truthful named
`join_failure`. See `deploy/compose/probe.sh` (a wrapper over `scripts/probe/journey.sh`).

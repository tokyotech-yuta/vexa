/**
 * Selector-validity gate — every selector array in this module must parse as a
 * VALID Playwright selector.
 *
 * WHY: the detector loops (admission / rejection / waiting / removal) wrap each
 * page.locator(sel).isVisible() in try/catch-continue. An INVALID selector
 * (e.g. the former `text*="…"` entries — `text*` is not a Playwright engine)
 * throws InvalidSelectorError on EVERY call and is silently skipped: a dead
 * selector that ships unnoticed, because the fabricated-DOM test mocks treat
 * selector strings as opaque keys and stay green. This gate makes that class
 * of bug fail loudly — no browser needed.
 *
 * HOW: playwright-core's server-side `Selectors.parseSelector` performs the
 * exact parse + engine validation the live locator path runs before touching
 * the page. playwright-core is resolved THROUGH the declared `playwright`
 * dependency, so validation always happens against the engine version this
 * module actually ships with (its exports map hides lib/server/selectors.js,
 * hence the two-step package.json resolution + direct file require).
 *
 * SCOPE: exported arrays whose name ends in `Selectors` or `Indicators` are
 * Playwright locator selectors. `*Texts` / `*ClassNames` exports are raw
 * strings consumed inside page.evaluate() / textContent matching — NOT
 * locator selectors — and are excluded on purpose.
 *
 * Run: npx tsx src/shared/selector-validity.test.ts

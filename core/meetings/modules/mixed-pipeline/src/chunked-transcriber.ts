/**
 * ChunkedTranscriber — THE single-channel transcription core for the MIXED lane
 * (in-tab extension, bot tab-audio, Zoom, MS Teams). One mixed audio stream in;
 * named transcript segments out.
 *
 *   PCM frames ──► RING BUFFER (passive, audio-time indexed)
 *      │              never submitted, never trimmed mid-flight
 *      │
 *      └──► PyannoteSegmenter (pyannote-segmentation-3.0) — the ONLY cut signal
 *               │  boundary {tMs, kind} at ~13ms frame resolution; the cut is
 *               │  applied RETROACTIVELY to an exact span from the ring. No
 *               │  embedding/clustering on the cut path → early, never slides.
 *               ▼
 *           TURN — opened on speech start / speaker change, closed on speaker
 *               change / speech end / overlap edge / TURN_MAX_MS roll / dispose.
 *               ▼
 *           CONTINUOUS CONFIRMATION (LocalAgreement-2, shared @vexa/transcribe-
 *           buffer): every commit resubmits the turn's UNCONFIRMED window
 *               [confirmedUpTo..t1] from the ring — one serialized Whisper
 *               call. Leading whisper segments whose words are STABLE
 *               across two consecutive submissions CONFIRM immediately
 *               (sentence-shaped, punctuated — whisper segments well with
 *               growing context); the still-forming tail publishes as
 *               PENDING. Confirmation advances the window, so long
 *               monologues confirm continuously — nobody waits for the
 *               turn to end.
 *               ▼
 *           On turn close: one last submission of the remaining window,
 *               everything confirms (last chance), pending clears. An empty
 *               final pass promotes the pending tail — turns are never lost.
 *
 *   WHO (the namer): speaker = the max-overlap lit-hint over the turn span
 *        (ClusterNameBinder, hints-only — no diarization). The per-turn
 *        segmentation id is the key; a turn with no overlapping hint publishes
 *        provisionally under that id and is repainted in place (same segment_ids)
 *        when a later hint produces a window match. NO speaker clustering — the
 *        cut is segmentation, the name is hints.
 *
 * Prompt chaining: every submission carries the tail of the confirmed text
 * (across turns too) as initial_prompt.
 *
 * What is deliberately ABSENT: live mutable buffers, trim/in-flight
 * reconciliation, and any speaker-embedding/clustering. Audio→text is a pure
 * function of the ring span; ordering falls out of the strictly serialized queue.

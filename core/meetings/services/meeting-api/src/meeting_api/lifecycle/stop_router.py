"""The user-stop HTTP route — ``DELETE /bots/{platform}/{native_meeting_id}`` (api.v1).

The stop *logic* lives in ``stop.py`` (``request_stop`` → publish a ``leave`` command + mark
``stop_requested``); this is its HTTP wrapper, a mountable ``APIRouter`` (the modular-monolith
composition, P2), behaviour-matched to the parent ``meetings.stop_bot``:

  1. Resolve the caller (``x-user-id`` the gateway injects after it validates ``x-api-key``).
  2. ``find_active`` the user's non-terminal meeting for ``(platform, native_id)`` — 404 if none.
  3. Mark it ``stopping`` + ``stop_requested`` (so the exit is later attributed to a user stop, never a
     silent failure), then PUBLISH ``bot_commands:meeting:{id}`` ``{"action":"leave"}``.
  4. The bot honours the command, leaves, and emits its terminal ``lifecycle.v1`` event — which the
     existing ``/bots/internal/callback/lifecycle`` handler classifies (→ ``completed``/``failed``,
     ``meeting.status_change`` webhook fires). This route TRIGGERS the stop; it never jumps the FSM itself.

The redis side is a port (``CommandPublisher``) so tests drive it with an in-memory capture and prod
injects the real ``redis_client.publish``.

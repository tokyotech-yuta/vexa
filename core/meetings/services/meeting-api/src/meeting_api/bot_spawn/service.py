"""The ``POST /bots`` flow — port of the parent ``meetings.request_bot`` (P2 core + P3 control-plane).

P3 added (all behind the same injected ports, so the flow still runs offline):
  * **continue_meeting** (P3c) — when the prior meeting for (platform, native_id) is TERMINAL,
    reuse the SAME meeting row + create a NEW ``MeetingSession`` instead of a fresh meeting (the
    409 only fires for a CONCURRENT, still-active prior meeting). Transcripts/recordings stay keyed
    by the meeting row, so a continued run preserves them.
  * **max-bots** (P3e) — a per-user concurrency pre-check: count the user's ACTIVE bots (excluding
    infra ``browser_session``) and reject the N+1th with 429 BEFORE spawning; the runtime kernel's
    own ``QuotaExceeded`` remains the defense-in-depth backstop.

The flow (parent ``meetings.py`` lines ~1010-1403, reduced to the standard-bot branch):
  1. construct the meeting URL (or use the supplied one),
  2. dedup — 409 if the user already has an active/requested meeting for (platform, native_id),
  2b. max-bots — 429 if the user is at their per-user concurrency cap (P3e),
  2c. continue_meeting — reuse a TERMINAL prior meeting row + add a session (P3c),
  3. insert the ``Meeting`` row (status ``requested``) → meeting_id (unless reusing one),
  4. mint the MeetingToken + build the ``invocation.v1`` invocation (BOT_CONFIG),
  5. spawn the meeting-bot workload over ``runtime.v1`` (``RuntimeClient.create_workload``),
  6. eager-create the ``MeetingSession`` keyed by the bot's ``connectionId`` (== session_uid),
  7. write the kernel workload id back as ``bot_container_id``,
  8. return the ``api.v1`` ``MeetingResponse`` (now listing its ``sessions``).

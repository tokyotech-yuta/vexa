"""Meeting-link → ``(platform, native_meeting_id)`` parsing — the server-side twin of the
terminal's ``clients/terminal/src/surfaces/meetingId.ts`` (same id formats, same platforms).

Used by ``POST /meetings`` / ``PATCH /meetings/{id}`` (a planned meeting created from a pasted
link) and by ``calendar_sync`` (extracting the joinable link out of an ICS event's LOCATION /
DESCRIPTION). Pure string logic — no I/O, no framework imports; the one config read is
``VEXA_JITSI_HOSTS`` (P14, declared in config.v1.json), consulted per call so tests and
reloads see the live env.

Id formats (mirrors the dashboard join-form):
  * google_meet → ``abc-defg-hij``
  * zoom        → 9–11 digits
  * teams       → the ``19:meeting_…@thread.v2`` thread id, or the ``/meet/<id>`` short-link segment
  * jitsi       → the room name (the URL's path segment). Hosts: meet.jit.si and
                  ``VEXA_JITSI_HOSTS``-declared deployments always; *jitsi* / meet-labelled
                  hosts on pasted links only. The room name is deployment-scoped, so the raw
                  URL rides alongside as ``meeting_url`` — never reconstructed from the id.
